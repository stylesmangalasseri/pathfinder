Solution for finding the shortest path in given custom route map using ASTART Algorithm

A* (A-Star) search algorithm
--------------------------------
 Â   The A* (A-Star) search algorithm is a path-finding algorithm with many uses, including Artificial Intelligence for games. The search builds the route from tile to tile until it reaches the goal. 
To help choose the best possible tile the algorithm will use an equation that takes into account the distance from the tile to the goal and the cost of moving to that tile.

Custom route map details
--------------------------------
Non-walkable:

    Water (~)

Walkable:

    Flatlands (. or @ or X)
    Forest (*)
    Mountain (^)
    
Movement Cost for Terrain:

    N/A = Water (~)
    1 = Flatlands (. or @ or X)
    2 = Forest (*)
    3 = Mountain (^)
